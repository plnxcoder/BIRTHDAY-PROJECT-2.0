        Dear [GUNU] ❤️,<br><br>

        On this special day, I want to wish you the happiest birthday ever. I may not be the best with words, but today
        I want to express everything my heart holds for you 💖.

        The most beautiful chapter of my life began the day I went to Lingaraj Temple. It wasn't just a visit to our
        favourite God, Mahadev 🕉️—it was the moment my life changed forever. That day, fate brought me to you, and I
        felt something I had never felt before. That peace, that comfort, that smile... I felt like I had found a
        missing piece of my soul.

        From that first meeting, I knew you were special. And every single day since, you've proved it. You've become my
        reason to smile 😊, my safe place in chaos, and the one who understands me even in silence.

        Every moment with you feels magical, but the moments when we go on a date? Those are something else... It’s like
        stepping into heaven with you by my side 💫. You make even the simplest things feel extraordinary. Your
        laughter, your care, the way you always try to make me happy... it means the world to me 🥹❤️.

        You may not be my first love, but you are my LAST LOVE—my forever, my always, my everything ❤️‍🔥.

        You’ve given me memories that I’ll hold close for a lifetime. You make me feel seen, heard, and truly loved. And
        I promise, I’ll walk with you—through every smile, every tear, every storm, and every sunshine 🌦️☀️.

        On your birthday, I pray to Mahadev 🕉️ to always bless you with happiness, strength, success, and health. And I
        also pray for us—that we keep growing, loving, and living this beautiful journey of ours together 💑.

        Happy Birthday, my love. You are not just special—you are my home. 🏡💖

        Forever yours,<br><br>
        [Your PARI] 💍💞
